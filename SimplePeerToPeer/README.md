## Purpose:
Very basic peer-2-peer for a chat. All peers can communicate with each other. 

Each peer is client and server at the same time. 
When started the peer has a ServerThread in which the peer listens for potential other peers to connect.

You want to first start the leader who is the one in charge of the network
